This code was written by David Medine at SCCN, UCSD based on an earlier version by Chadwick Boulay.

In order to compile, you will need the Emotiv Premium SDK. Once you have purchased and installed this, create an environment variable called EDK_ROOT that points to the EDK install directory. On my computer this is C:\Program Files (x86)\Emotiv SDK Premium Edition v3.3.2\EDK. The vcproj is set up to find the EDK headers and libraries relative to this. You will also need to copy the file $(EDK_ROOT)\x86\edk.dll into this directory in order to run the application once it is compiled.
